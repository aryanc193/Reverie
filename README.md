# Reverie

Private, AI-assisted journaling and memory app.

Engineering principles:
- AI is async, explicit, and constrained
- No implicit context or memory
- User owns and controls data
- Backend is source of truth

This repo contains:
- backend/ (Node + Express + Mongo)
- frontend/ (Next.js)

See docs/ for architecture notes.
